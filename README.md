**Project Description**

We are conducting an end-to-end analysis of a dataset (regression_data.xls/.csv). The analysis includes a regression model to **Predict selling prices of houses in King County, WA** based on certain features provided in the dataset, such as location, renovation status and size. The model also aims at understanding which factors are responsible for higher property value ($650K and above).
The dataset consists of historic data of around 22,000 properties sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

To sum up the outcome of our prediction models: 


This project is part of the IRONHACK Data Analysis bootcamp from January to June 2023.

**Usage Instructions**

The repository contains:
- The original dataset provided for the project (see above) and a reduced dataset after cleaning (data_cleaned.csv) as well as after processing (data_processed.csv).
- A Jupyter notebook with the analysis and the regression models (mid-bootcamp-project-regression.ipynb). 
- An SQL-Query-File exploring the data further (sql_queries_file.sql)
- A Tableau Public workbook to visualize the data (data_mid_bootcamp_project_regression.twbx)

We have created a documentation of our workflow here: https://trello.com/b/Sg2OBiDB/mid-bootcamp-project-property-prices
